### 1. Sprint Meeting 1 (9/15)
In the first sprint, the team focused on designing the application's architecture. The project was divided into two microservices: User Service and Restaurant Service. The frontend team, consisting of Jinwoo Bae and Shanmukha Manoj Kakani, began developing a responsive and interactive user interface using React. The backend team, Aditya Rao and Nikhil Koli, initiated the development of the User Service, which included functionalities for login and registration. The foundational MySQL schema and MongoDB schema was established during this sprint to support the application.

---

### 2. Sprint Meeting 2 (10/2)
The second sprint concentrated on integrating the frontend and backend. The User Service APIs were successfully connected to the frontend, enabling smooth user registration and login processes. The backend team, led by Aditya and Nikhil, made significant progress on the Restaurant Service, focusing on building APIs for managing restaurant data. Meanwhile, the team started deploying the application on AWS, configuring the necessary environment for scalability and high availability.

---

### 3. Sprint Meeting 3 (10/23)
During the third sprint, the team finalized the core functionalities of the application. The frontend team developed a dynamic search feature and improved UI components for better user interaction. The backend team completed additional endpoints for restaurant management, including features for restaurant search and feedback handling. Business rules, such as preventing duplicate entries and enforcing user validations, were implemented. Testing was conducted to ensure the application met all functional requirements.

---

### 4. Sprint Meeting 4 (11/12)
In the final sprint, the team focused on deployment and optimization. The backend services were deployed on AWS using an auto-scaled EC2 cluster and a MySQL RDS instance to ensure high performance and reliability. The frontend team refined UI elements, added error handling, and addressed any remaining bugs. With all services fully integrated and tested, the project was prepared for final submission and demonstration.

## XP Core Values

### Simplicity
The team focused on developing only the most important features during each sprint, adhering to the simplicity concept. The backend team created simple, modular microservices for user and restaurant management that were easy to expand if necessary, rather than over-engineering solutions. By putting usability ahead of needless complication, the frontend team produced a simple and easy-to-use user interface. The team was able to create a scalable and functional application on schedule by maintaining a minimal architecture.

### Feedback
To raise the overall caliber of the application, the team aggressively solicited input from one another throughout the development process. Team members assessed finished features, including the restaurant search and user authentication system, during sprint reviews and offered helpful recommendations for improvements. Frequent testing and incremental enhancements made that the program worked as intended and fulfilled user expectations. The team was able to improve their work and produce a polished end result by placing a strong emphasis on feedback.
